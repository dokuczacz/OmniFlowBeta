# 🧠 PA_DB v2: Personal Assistant Knowledge Base (Omni Format)

This is version 2.0 of the structured GPT-compatible Personal Assistant database. It includes fully normalized entries extracted from real sessions, organized by functionality, semantically tagged, and bridged for use in RAG, assistant tuning, or intelligent planner applications.

---

## 📚 Categories & Taxonomy

Each entry belongs to one of the core knowledge domains:

- **TM — Task Management**: captures todos, task lists, and user commands to structure work or personal flows.
- **PS — Planning Strategy**: for high-level planning, goal setting, or calendar/priority design.
- **UI — User Interaction**: UI-level guidance, input transformations, formatting changes, user-facing controls.
- **PE — Prompt Engineering**: covers GPT flows, system message variations, function-call prompts, and tuning.
- **GEN — General Knowledge**: ideas, meta-queries, improvements, and assistant feedback interactions.
- **LO — Life Optimization**: routines, habit formation, reflections, and long-term personal growth strategy.

---

## 🛠 Entry Format (Standardized for Omni Extractor)

```markdown
[📁 CATEGORY: TM]

```

- Always begins with `[📁 CATEGORY: X]`
- Ends with `[🕒(✅) X.ID.TIMESTAMP]`
- Includes optional `[🏷 TAGS]` line for downstream filtering and RAG embedding

---

## 🔄 v2 Features & Enhancements

- ✅ 2,491 entries normalized and deduplicated
- ✅ 48 newly added entries from real session logs
- ✅ 184 modified entries reclassified or clarified
- 🔗 41,064 semantic bridges auto-generated
- 🏷 9 topic domains applied as auto-tags (`calendar`, `habit`, `finance`, etc.)
- 🧩 Full category-split files, summary index, and bridge log included

---

## 📦 Output Files

- `pa_tm_clean_entries_v2.txt`
- `pa_ps_clean_entries_v2.txt`
- `pa_ui_clean_entries_v2.txt`
- `pa_pe_clean_entries_v2.txt`
- `pa_gen_clean_entries_v2.txt`
- `pa_lo_clean_entries_v2.txt`
- `pa_db_v2_summary_index.csv`
- `pa_db_v2_bridges.txt`

---

## 🧩 Conceptual Foundations

This PA DB was created and refined based on two guiding architecture files:

- `___PersonalAssistance_concept.txt` — original RAG-style assistant, memory + flow planner logic.
- `___PersonalAssistance_concept_2.txt` — streamlined OmniFlow-compatible task manager blueprint.

Together, these documents define the assistant's behavioral frame, planning API logic, and long-term evolution model.

---

## 🌐 Use Cases

- GPT-4 function-calling scaffolding
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant support
- Habit trackers & reflective planners
- Daily task manager integration
- Auto-suggestion training base for PAs
